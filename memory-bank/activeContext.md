# Active Context & Next Steps

- **Current State:**
    - The `HomePage`, `AboutUsPage`, `CareersPage`, and `PricingPage` are visually and functionally complete based on the Figma designs.
    - A full contact form flow has been implemented under the `/contact` route, including a dynamic, context-aware `ThankYouPage`.
    - The `StudentForm` (`/contact`) is complete with validation.
    - The `TeacherForm` (`/contact/careers`) is complete with multi-select validation and a custom file upload interface.
    - The project's component architecture has proven to be highly effective and scalable.

- **Immediate Task:** The core front-end structure and the main pages are now complete. The application is in a very stable state.

- **Next Logical Steps:**
    1.  **Build Out Subject Pages:** The template for individual subject pages (`/screens/SubjectPage`) is built. The next major task is to populate the `subjectsData.js` file with the content for all remaining subjects and years.
    2.  **Build Remaining Static Pages:** Create and route the final pages from the navbar (`/subjects` main page, `/contact` if it's different from the form, etc.).
    3.  **Backend Integration Planning:** Begin planning the specific data shapes and endpoints for the API that will eventually replace the hardcoded data in `subjectsData.js` and handle form submissions.
    4.  **Introduce State Management:** For features like authentication, a state management solution (like React Context API or a library like Redux/Zustand) will be necessary. This needs to be planned and implemented.
