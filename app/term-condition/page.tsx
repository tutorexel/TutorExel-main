                      <p>
                        The failure of TutorExel to enforce any right or
                        provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver
                        of such right or provision. Any waiver shall be
                        effective only if made in writing and signed by an
                        authorised representative of TutorExel. The exercise of
                        any remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
                        remedy available under law or these Terms.

                      <p>
                        If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or
                        unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
                        provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent
                        permissible, and the remaining provisions shall remain
                        in full force and effect.
