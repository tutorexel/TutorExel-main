Text A frames technological progress as inevitable, emphasising efficiency and innovation, while Text B adopts a more cautious stance, foregrounding ethical concerns and social consequences. Although both texts address the same issue, their differing assumptions about progress shape how evidence is selected and presented. As a result, readers are positioned to either accept rapid advancement as necessary or question its broader implications. <br />
